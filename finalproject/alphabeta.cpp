	cout << "1. You choose the length of the number(3 - 9)." << endl;
	cout << "2. A random number of that length is generated with unique digits." << endl;
	cout << "3. You try to guess that number." << endl;
	cout << "4. You get 'alpha's for every digit that you guess correctly - that is in the number and in that specific place." << endl;
	cout << "5. You get 'beta's for every digit that you guess correctly - that is in the number but in a different place." << endl;
	cout << "6. You win when you correctly guess the entire number." << endl;
	cout << "7. Simple as that." << endl;
